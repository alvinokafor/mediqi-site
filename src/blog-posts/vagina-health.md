Do you know that every vagina has its own unique smell? And No, Vaginas do not smell like roses and they should not be expected to. However, a change in the familiar scent may be an indicator that something is wrong.
Most women are sensitive to a change in the normal smell of their vagina with complaints ranging from a slightly off smell to a strong offensive odour which may be associated with an abnormal discharge.

The smell of the vagina at any time is affected by the environment and activities engaged in. The vagina may take on a different smell because of exercise, sex, hormonal shifts during pregnancy, menstruation or even menopause.

### Causes of unplesant vagina smell

#### Bacterial Vaginosis

This occurs when there is an overgrowth of the bad bacteria that exists in the vagina. Normally, there’s a balance of both bad and good bacteria in the vagina. However, sometimes, certain factors can lead to an increase in the number of the bad bacteria and this imbalance results in the condition called, bacterial vaginosis. Most common complaint is a fishy odour especially after sex. Other associated complaints are;

- Whitish or milk coloured vaginal discharge.
- Burning sensation while urinating.
- Itching, burning or pain in vagina.
- To decrease risk of BV, women are advised to abstain from douching and using harsh feminine products that can cause a change in the vaginal environment which favours the growth of the bad bacteria.
- It is also advised to practice safe sex and refrain from having multiple sexual partners.

#### Hygiene

Having a good hygiene is key to maintaining a clean, offensive odour free vagina. The vagina, like other parts of the body contains glands and sweats. This can lead to the build up of bacteria if not adequately washed. Also, it’s proximity to the anus makes it easy for the spread of bacteria. It is therefore important that these areas are properly cleaned especially after using the toilet.

#### Trichomoniasis

This is a sexually transmitted infection that is a common cause of foul vaginal smell. Commonly reported symptoms are; abnormal vaginal discharge that may be yellowish or greenish associated with a strong offensive odour. Other symptoms are; pain when having sex, discomfort when urinating, itching or pain in the vagina.
People with trichomoniasis would require antibiotics to clear the infection.

#### Nutrition

The foods we consume has been shown to affect the normal smell of the vagina. For e.g; consumption of high amounts of sugary foods can favour the growth of yeast in the vagina. Also, not taking enough water can also lead to a foul vagina smell as staying hydrated reduces risk of bacterial overgrowth. In addition, smoking, alcohol and foods like garlic, onions and cauliflower can cause a less pleasant small, while foods like apples and watermelons are believed to be associated with a more pleasant vagina scent.

### To avoid and get rid of bad vagina odour, do the following;

- Adopt and maintain a good body hygiene. Bathe and change your clothes, especially pants and other underwears regularly.
- Decrease intake of sugar and drink more water to stay hydrated.
- Avoid wearing, tight fitting underwear. Always opt for fresh, clean underwear, preferably cotton. Do not repeat them without washing.
- Do not douche! Using strong feminine products like harsh soaps and douches does more harm than good.
- Practice safe sex by using condoms and limiting number of sexual partners.

### Summary

An offensive vagina smell is quite common and many women suffer from this. This condition affects a woman's self esteem and sexual pleasure as she will be conscious of herself, wondering how she is being perceived by her partner. You may need to seek medical advice if you are having recurrent yeast infection, ulcers or blisters in the vagina, problems urinating, pain, swelling or redness in the genital area as these could be signs of an underlying health condition requiring further investigations and medical attention.
