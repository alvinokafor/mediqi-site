At its core, male infertility means a man has difficulty getting a partner pregnant due to
issues with his sperm—either in count, shape, movement, or function. A healthy sperm
count ranges from 15 million to 200 million per milliliter of semen. A few decades ago, the
lower limit was 20 million. Now it’s 15. That subtle shift is a major warning sign—a global
decline in male reproductive health. Even more concerning, poor sperm quality can increase the risk of genetic mutations, leading to higher chances of neurodevelopmental conditions in children—such as autism, ADHD, and mood disorders.

#### WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

The short answer? Lifestyle and environment. Below is a breakdown of the key contributors:

#### Factors Driving the Rise in Male Infertility

Lifestyle & Environmental Factors:

- Exposure to toxins (plastics, pollution)

- Poor diet & chronic stress

- Smoking & excessive alcohol

- Obesity & sedentary habits

- Overheating (saunas, tight underwear)

- Delayed fatherhood (aging sperm)

- Excessive caffeine

Medical & Biological Causes:

- Infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, mumps)

- Varicocele or blocked sperm ducts

- Undescended testes

- Chemotherapy or radiation exposure

- Hormonal imbalances & low testosterone

- Genetic conditions (e.g., Klinefelter's)

- Idiopathic (unknown causes)

#### What Can You Do to Protect Your Sperm?

The good news? Many of the contributing factors are within your control.

Lifestyle fixes that matter:

- Quit smoking and cut back on alcohol and excessive caffeine.

- Eat antioxidant-rich foods (like berries, leafy greens, nuts, and fish).

- Exercise regularly, but don’t overtrain—extreme workouts can reduce sperm quality.

- Avoid heat exposure: skip tight underwear, long bike rides, and hot tubs.

- Sleep well and manage stress levels—it matters more than you think.

- You might also consider moderate antioxidant supplements—but always under a
  doctor’s guidance.

### WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR

If you and your partner have been trying to conceive without success, don’t wait. A simple
semen analysis and hormonal blood test can often pinpoint the issue. Depending on the
findings, options like lifestyle changes, medications, surgery (e.g., varicocele repair), or
assisted reproductive technologies (like IVF or ICSI) may be recommended.

Male infertility is no longer rare. It’s not a reflection of your masculinity—it’s a call to check
in on your overall health. Your sperm isn’t just about fertility; it’s a mirror of your hormonal,
physical, and environmental wellbeing. And by taking small, proactive steps today, you’re
investing not just in fertility—but in a longer, healthier life.
