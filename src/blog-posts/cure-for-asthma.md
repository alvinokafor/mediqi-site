Asthma is a common condition found in 262 million people worldwide, according to a estimates done in 2019. In Nigeria alone, the number of people with clinically diagnosed asthma is approximately 13 million. These figures are projected to be one of the highest in Africa.
It is no surprise then that many would wonder about a permanent cure for this condition as it can be quite bothersome especially in people with more severe disease as they have frequent attacks. The search for a cure has led to the use of different medications, supplements and even herbal concoctions. Many are given the false hope of a cure which has resulted in fatal attacks with many losing their lives because they discarded the medicine that could’ve potentially saved them.

#### WHAT HAPPENS DURING AN ATTACK?

People with asthma usually have a personal or family history of what is known as atopy.
Atopy simply means your body is more sensitive to some things in the environment and you are more likely to develop allergies due to the heightened or exaggerated response of your immune system.

During an asthma attack, the muscles you use for breathing tightens. There is swelling of your airways and clogging of the airways by mucus. This makes it difficult for air to move in or out of your lungs. This is why you feel you are being strangled. Coughing as a reflex is initiated with the aim of relieving the obstruction and get air. There may also be associated wheezing, which is a high pitched whistling like sound. This is as a result of narrowing of the airway.

#### IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE CURED?

At present, there is no cure for asthma. What people perceive as a cure is a symptom free period. It is possible that as one grows older, the immune system has less response to previous triggers and you could have a milder form of the disease or even no response at all. This does not however mean caution should be thrown as many people who have been symptom free for a long time often do. Most people who suffered severe, fatal attacks had been without symptoms for years which they attributed to a cure only to have an attack unprepared.
Even if you have not had any episode for a long time, avoid triggers that could potentially elicit a response.

#### TIPS TO PREVENT ATTACKS

While there is no cure, prevention of episodes and control of symptoms is attainable and greatly impacts your quality of life.

- Identify what sets it off. This is known as triggers and may not be same for everyone. Some common triggers are dust, smoke, cold. Others are perfumes, paints, insecticides. Some attacks can be triggered by exercise and even stress.
In Nigeria, the recent change in weather and rains has resulted in an increasing number of episodes.

- Stop smoking. Smoking worsens symptoms of asthma and also reduces the effectiveness of your asthma medicine. Also, stay away from people who are smoking. Episodes have been triggered by frying, use of firewood, etc.

- Correct use of medications. The right technique ensures that the medicine gets to your airway in the adequate dose to provide relief.

- Always take your medicine as directed by your doctor. People have different severity of the disease and may need more than one medicine to properly control your’s. You can use 1-2 puffs of your reliever inhaler up to 4 times in a 24 hour period. If you have no relief, you need to seek medical help as you may require additional medicines.

- Stay Healthy. Exercise helps to boost your immunity and help you maintain a healthy body weight. Because this can also trigger an attack in some people, ensure that your asthma is well controlled and check with your doctor to guide you on the best type of exercise to engage in. Exercise also strengthens the muscles you use for respiration. Reduce risk of getting sick by staying away from others who are ill and wear a mask when needed.

### CONCLUSION

There is no known cure for asthma. You can control the symptoms and even be symptom free for years, but you need to remain mindful of triggers and potential triggers. When going on a long trip or even engaging in an outdoor activity like hiking, carry an inhaler with you at all times. Common reports of fatal attacks occurred in spaces where immediate emergency medical services could not be accessed and the person had no inhaler for quick relief.
